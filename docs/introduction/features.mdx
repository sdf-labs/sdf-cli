### Authentication Support
SDF Supports authentication to one or more databases simultaneously through providers & credentials.

To check the current status of all credentials held by SDF, run `sdf auth status`.

### Orchestration Support
SDF Supports simple orchestration. Commands like `compile` & `run` are executed in dependency order, allowing for simple orchestration via cron jobs, or github actions.

For more advanced orchestration needs, SDF recommends [Dagster](https://dagster.com).
