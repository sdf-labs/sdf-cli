<Note>
  When we say "SQL Dialect Support", we mean support for SDF's rich static analysis toolset - including compilation, lineage, dependency analysis, and more.
</Note>

### Authentication Support
SDF Supports authentication to one or more databases simultaneously through providers & credentials.

To check the current status of all credentials held by SDF, run `sdf auth status`.

### Orchestration Support
SDF Supports simple orchestration. Commands like `compile` & `run` are executed in dependency order, allowing for simple orchestration via cron jobs, or github actions.

For more advanced orchestration needs, SDF recommends [Dagster](https://dagster.com).

| Orchestrator | Supported | Documentation |
|--------------|:---------:|:--------------|
| Github       | 🟢        | [here](https://github.com/sdf-labs/sdf-action) |
| Dagster      | 🟡        | Coming Soon  |
| Airflow      | 🟡        | Coming Soon  |

## Platforms

SDF is currently supported on the following platforms. The executable is small
(\<75mb), but heavily parallelized. As such, SDF's resource consumption is
dependent entirely on your data processing requirements.

| Platforms            | Supported |
| -------------------- | :-------: |
| Linux Intel X86-64   |    ✔️     |
| Linux Arm AARCH-64   |    ✔️     |
| Apple Intel X86-64   |    ✔️     |
| Apple Arm AARCh-64   |    ✔️     |
| Windows Intel X86-64 |    ❌     |
| Web-Assembly         |    ❌     |
