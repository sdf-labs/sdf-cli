<PreviewWarning title={'The SDF Linter'} />

### Overview

SDF contains an integrated high performance SQL linter and formatter. Linting and formatting are core competencies 
of code-hygiene designed ensure code is consistent across your organization, simplify readability, code reviews, 
and promote standardization.

SDF's SQL Linter has 4 crucial characteristics.
1. It is incredibly high performance, outperforming SQLFluff by well over 100X in most scenarios.
2. It has a high degree of overlap with SQL Fluff to ensure easy migration for existing SQLFLuff users.
3. It is out-of-the-box compatible with all SDF Jinja and configuration

SDF's auto-formatter works in conjunction with the linter to empower teams to write more unified SQL code.

Using the linter is easy.
* Unless otherwise configured, every SDF workspace has *Default Rules*.
* All files listed in your `includes` paths will be linted.
* Run `sdf lint` to lint sql files
* Run `sdf lint path/to/file.sql` to lint a subset of SQL files
* Run `sdf lint --fix` to fix issues where possible
* Run `sdf format` to format sql files

To create a global linter configuration for your workspace, you can use the `sdf-args` block in your sdf workspace file. These 
defaults are command line flags that are implicitly added to each invocation of `sdf lint`. 

```yml workspace.sdf.yml 
sdf-args
   lint: >
     -w <lint-rule>=<option>
     ...
```

#### Dialect Compatibility
SQL linting is dialect specific. Currently, SDF Lint is only available for the Snowflake and BigQuery SQL dialects. Other dialects are coming soon.
| Dialect   | Availability |
| --------- | ------------ | 
| Snowflake | 🟢           |
| BigQuery  | 🟢           |
| Redshift  | 🟡           |
| Trino     | 🔴           |
| SparkSQL  | 🔴           |


#### Default Rules
SDF has a set of default lint rules. Default rules designed to provide a simple configuration for most data teams. 
All defaults can be auto-fixed or overwritten through manual configuration.

SDF's lint defaults are equivalent to the following `sdf-args` configuration. If no overrides for `sdf-args` are specified, 
any invocation of `sdf lint` will use the default lint defaults. These defaults are as below: 
```yml workspace.sdf.yml 
sdf-args
   lint: >
      -w capitalization-keywords=consistent 
      -w capitalization-literals=consistent 
      -w capitalization-types=consistent 
      -w capitalization-functions=consistent 
      -w refernces-quoting
      -w structure-else-null
      -w structure-unused-cte
      -w structure-distinct
      -w structure-column-order
      -w convention-terminator
``` 
<Note>
All other rules are turned off by default.
</Note>

<Note>
All default lint rules can be automatically fixed with `sdf lint --fix`
</Note>

### Automatically Fix Issues
- Use `sdf lint --fix` to automatically resolve linting issues where possible
- For issues that can't be automatically fixed, SDF will provide error reports

```sql fix.sql
select * FROM test
```
### Ignore Warnings
If you would like to ignore a lint warning for whatever reason, add the 
inline comment `-- noqa` to your query. This will prevent that line from being 
evaluated by the linter, for all rules.

```sql nofix.sql
SeLeCt * from test --noqa
```

### Customize and Configure 
- By default, `sdf lint` uses SDF's recommended rules and configuration
- To customize linter rules according to your preferences, override the default settings with a `sdf-args` block in your `workspace.sdf.yml`

<Note>
The `sdf-args:` config block in a workspace file will override the default configuration.
</Note>

#### Default Rules
Per default, every SDF project has the following linter configuration turned on implicitly. 
If you specify your own YML linter configuration, you will **turn off** the default rules and need to specify *all linting rules* yourself.
