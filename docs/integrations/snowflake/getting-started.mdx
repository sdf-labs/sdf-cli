  "Getting started with Snowflake and SDF."

## Overview

SDF can hydrate table schemas and execute queries against a Snowflake DB. This guide will walk you through the steps of creating a Snowflake integration. By the end, you will be able to reference tables in your snowflake instance in SDF.

SDF will use remote Snowflake schema information to do type bindings and other static analysis checks on your workspace.

## Prerequisites

In order to connect to Snowflake, you will need to have on hand the following:

1. A Mac or Linux with a valid installation of the latest SDF version running locally.
2. A Snowflake account to connect to.
3. Valid credentials with read access to materialize tables in your Snowflake account.

## Guide

<Steps>
    <Step title="Collect Required Information">
        To connect to Snowflake, you need the following materials:
        * Account ID - the 8 digit organization identifier
        * Username - your Snowflake username
        * Password - your Snowflake password
        * Role - a role with appropriate permissions
        * Warehouse - The warehouse you are connecting to.

        Log in to your [Snowflake](https://app.snowflake.com/) account to find the relevant information.

        <Note>
	        Run `sdf auth login snowflake --help` to see all login options.
        </Note>

    </Step>
    <Step title="Connect SDF to Snowflake">
        Connect SDF to snowflake. SDF will prompt you for your Snowflake password.
        ``` shell
        sdf auth login snowflake --account-id <ACCOUNT_ID> --username <USERNAME> --role <ROLE> --warehouse <WAREHOUSE_NAME>
        ```
        
        <Info>
        This will create a new [credential](/reference/sdf-yml#block-credential) in a `~/.sdf/` directory in the root of your system. This credential will be used to authenticate with AWS services. By default, the 
        credential's name is default. As such, the credential does not need to be explicitly referenced in the provider configuration below.
        </Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add Snowflake Provider in Workspace">
        Once authenticated, add a table provider block in your `workspace.sdf.yml`. This tells SDF to use Snowflake to hydrate missing table schemas.
        ``` yml
        workspace:
            ...
            providers:
                - type: snowflake
                  sources: 
                    - pattern: <DATABASE>.*.*
        ```

        Replace `<DATABASE>` with the name of the database you want to hydrate. Note this is configurable and can be changed to any database you have access to. For example, if I wanted SDF to pull from two databases, called `db1` and `db2`, I would write:
        ``` yml
        workspace:
            ...
            providers:
                - type: snowflake
                  sources: 
                    - pattern: db1.*.*
                    - pattern: db2.*.*
        ```

        Providers can also be configured to use specific credentials by referencing the credential name in the provider block. For example, if you wanted to use a credential called `snowflake-creds`, you would write:
        ``` yml
        workspace:
            ...
            providers:
                - type: snowflake
                  credential: snowflake-creds
                  sources: 
                    - pattern: db1.schema1.mytable
                    - pattern: db2.schema2.*
        ```

        For more information on provider configuration, see the [provider documentation](/guide/transformation/providers).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Try it out!">
        Now that you're connected, let's make sure SDF can pull the schema information it needs. 

        Run `sdf compile -q "select * from <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.<TABLE>" --show all`

        If the connection is successful, you will see the schema for the table you selected.
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
The term 'DATABASE' in Snowflake is interchangeable with the term 'CATALOG' in SDF.
</Info>

## Configuring an SDF Role for Snowflake

Different SDF commands require different permissions from Snowflake, as such the Snowflake role SDF assumes should be configured to have the following permissions:

|| SELECT TABLE | SELECT VIEW | CREATE \<MATERIALIZATION\> | CREATE SCHEMA | CREATE DATABASE |
|-|:------------:|:-----------:|:--------------------------:|:-------------:|:---------------:|
| `compile` | 🟢 | 🟢 | | | |
| `run` | 🟢 | 🟢 | 🟢 | 🟢 | 🟢 |

<Note>
The `CREATE MATERIALIZATION` permission listed above is meant to be subsituted with the materialization type you are using. For example, if you are using `table` materializations, the permission should be `CREATE TABLE`. If using views or transient tables, the permission should be `CREATE VIEW` or `CREATE TRANSIENT TABLE` respectively.
If you'd like to grant all write access on a database, these can be easily achieved with a `grant all` command on the database.
</Note>

Required permissions for your Snowflake role are based on your provider configuration, as this determines where SDF will attempt to write models out to and where it will read schemas from.

Let's imagine we had the following provider configuration:
```yml
  providers:
    - type: snowflake
      credential: limited
      sources: 
        - pattern: my_production_database.*.*
      targets:
        - pattern: my_production_database.*.*
          rename-as: dev_sandbox.${1}.${2}
```

As we can see from the provider, SDF will read schemas from the `my_production_database` database and write models to the `dev_sandbox` database.

<Tip>
  Despite `my_production_database` being included as a target, SDF only requires write access to the databases and schemas after the rename operation. As such, the `dev_sandbox` schema should be the only schema that requires write access.
</Tip>


Now let's create a role `sdf_dev_role` with permissions to write to the `dev_sandbox` database and read from the `my_production_database` database. This role will model exactly what's required to compile and run with the provider above.

```sql
-- Create the role
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS sdf_dev_role;

-- Allow your user to assume this role. Replace \<YOUR_USERNAME\> with the Snowflake username you're using with SDF.
GRANT ROLE sdf_dev_role TO USER \<YOUR_USERNAME\>;

-- Grant the role access to the warehouse. Replace \<MY_WAREHOUSE\> with the name of your warehouse.
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE \<MY_WAREHOUSE\> TO ROLE sdf_dev_role;

-- Grant the role read access to all tables and views in `my_production_database`
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE my_production_database TO ROLE sdf_dev_role;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE my_production_database TO ROLE sdf_dev_role;

-- Everything above is all that is necessary for `sdf compile`. If you want to run models, you'll need to grant the following permissions as well.

-- Grant the role write access to the `dev_sandbox` database
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE elias_sandbox TO ROLE sdf_dev_role;

-- Lastly, if you'd like SDF to be able to create databases for you as you author them locally, you'll need to grant the following permissions as well.
-- This is useful for provisioning new sandbox datases per-developer.
GRANT CREATE DATABASE ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE sdf_dev_role;
```

## Next Steps 

Now that you have connected to Snowflake, you can start materializing tables in Snowflake. Check out the [Snowflake materialization](/integrations/snowflake/basic-materialization) guide to get started.
