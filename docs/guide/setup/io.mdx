title: "Display and IO"
---

One of the beloved parts of software engineering is how developers have managed to keep their development workflows contained to the terminal.
Terminal workflows allow automation via **stdin**, **stdout**, and **stderr**, and cross-compatibility with virtually all operating systems. 

As such, SDF is designed to be a command line tool and can ideally keep the large majority of your data development contained to the terminal (and your IDE of choice). 
For you vim and emacs legends of the world: we want you to develop data workflows in your natural habitat - the terminal. Automate & integrate.

As a byproduct, we take output *seriously*. This guide will take you through how to configure your terminal environment to get the most out of SDF.

<Note>
Simply put, SDF allows you to specify 
* **display formats**, as part of *CLI* options for command line output
* **input files (format and location)**, as part of Data Providers
* **output files (format and location)**, as part of Providers, Data Providers, and Materialization options
* **table schemas** through inference, files, or Providers 
</Note>

## Display Options

SDF writes progress or results on stdout. It provides the developer with a variety of logging and output options to enable scripting, debugging, and other use cases.

### Command-line options 

#### Inputs / Selectors

All SDF SQL processing commands take a list of targets as input.

For example, the `compile` and `run` commands can take targets in multiple formats:
  * `sdf compile catalog.schema.table_name` *using fully qualified name*
  * `sdf compile table_name` *using table name and inferred fully qualified name from the default catalog and schema*
  * `sdf compile /path/to/table_name.sql` *using file path*
  * `sdf compile catalog.*.*`  *using glob pattern to compile multiple targets*
  * `sdf compile [No params]` *using no params compiles the whole workspace*
  * `sdf compile /path/to/workspace` *enables compiling a workspace from outside the workspace directory*
  * `sdf run -q "SELECT * FROM table_name"` *using a query string*

<Tip>
  Running SDF commands from the workspace directory, adjacent to the `workspace.sdf.yml` file, is best practice as error messages and logs will use the relative path from the workspace root in their output.
</Tip>

#### Outputs

There are 4 commandline options to control the output.

- `--show (all | progress | result | none)` - Print desired amount of information, i.e., produced tables.

  - `all` prints progress, results, and any warnings and errors
  - `progress` prints the progress of files as they are compiled
  - `result` prints the tables parsed and the schema assocaited
  - `none` prints nothing. This will also prevent the `Finished in [n] seconds` message from displaying at the end of stdout.

- `--format (table | csv | tsv | json | nd-json | yml)` - Specifies the table representation
  on stdout.

  - `table` (default) is the normal ascii table representation.
  - `csv` is a CSV representation
  - `tsv` is a TSV representation
  - `json` is a JSON representation
  - `nd-json` is an ndJSON representation
  - `yml`, is YML representation

- `--limit <number>` - Limits the number of shown rows. Run with `--limit 0` to show all rows.

### Example

Let's try these options. Start by creating a new SDF workspace with a sample project or change directories into an existing one. The tutorial below uses the *lineage* sample.
<Steps>

  <Step title="Install and setup your workspace">
    To start with a sample workspace lineage 'new --sample lineage' will generate a new workspace folder to walk through this example.
    
    ```shell	
		sdf new --sample lineage
		```
    After running the command, you will see the following output:
    
<div className="bg-[#0F1117] dark:bg-codeblock rounded-xl dark:ring-1 dark:ring-gray-800/50 relative">
<pre style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace', backgroundColor: 'transparent' }} className='language-shell'>
<code className='language-shell'>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Created&nbsp;lineage/models/sink.sql
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Created&nbsp;lineage/models/source.sql
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Created&nbsp;lineage/workspace.sdf.yml
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome&nbsp;to&nbsp;your&nbsp;new&nbsp;SDF&nbsp;Workspace!&nbsp;To&nbsp;help&nbsp;you&nbsp;on&nbsp;your&nbsp;journey:

</code>
</pre>
</div>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Change Directory">
    Switch directories into the newly created lineage workspace.
    
```shell	
cd lineage/
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compile lineage Workspace with --show command">
    Compile the workspace and review the output.
    
```shell	
sdf compile
```
    Reviewing this output, multiple files have been compiled and SDF has statically analyzed the queries.

<div className="bg-[#0F1117] dark:bg-codeblock rounded-xl dark:ring-1 dark:ring-gray-800/50 relative">
<pre style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace', backgroundColor: 'transparent' }} className='language-shell'>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finished&nbsp;4&nbsp;models&nbsp;[4&nbsp;succeeded]&nbsp;in&nbsp;0.780&nbsp;secs

</code>
</pre>
</div>

    Add the `--show all` command to display all information after compile

```shell
sdf compile --show all
```

  Reviewing this output, SDF provides progress and table information. SDF reuses model files that have already been compiled and have not been edited. 
  Alternatively try compiling with various output options:
  ```shell
  sdf compile --show [all, none, progress, result]
  ```

  For execution - you may also modulate table output formats. Let's take the `lineage.pub.middle` table.
  ```shell
  sdf run lineage.pub.middle --format [nd-json, csv, tsv, yml, table]
  ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Display for Individual Tables">
  To select the output of only one table, use the table name directly after the `compile` command.

  ```shell
  sdf compile models/sink.sql
  ```

  <Note>
      The `compile` command can take targets in multiple formats.
      * `sdf compile catalog.schema.table_name` *using fully qualified name*
      * `sdf compile table_name` *using table name and inferred fully qualified name*
      * `sdf compile /path/to/table_name.sql` *using file path*
      * `sdf compile catalog.*.*`  *using glob pattern to compile multiple targets*
      * `sdf compile [No params]` *using no params compiles the whole workspace*
  </Note>

  </Step>
</Steps>
  
### Schema

The `schema` of an external table must be given **explicitly**, following the [ANSI standard SQL syntax](https://blog.ansi.org/2018/10/sql-standard-iso-iec-9075-2016-ansi-x3-135/) or

<Tip>
  External tables are tables that load data from external sources.
</Tip>

An example for an explicit table definition looks like this

```sql
create external table events (
    dt date not null,
    action varchar not null,
    user_id smallint not null)
    ...
```

Besides column names, types and nullability, SDF schema definitions have no
other schema descriptions, no foreign keys, no constraints.
