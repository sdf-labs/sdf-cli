## Overview

Environments are a way to separate your workspace into different contexts, each with its own set of configurations, credentials, and dependencies. Imagine a local developer wants to materialize a table in their Snowflake warehouse, but they don't want to overwrite the production version of the table they are updating. 
They can use an environment to materialize the table to a sandbox environment locally, then materialize to the production environment after deployment without changes to the code.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning to understand the following examples, you should have an understanding of the following concepts:

- [Workspace](/guide/setup/workspaces)
- [Materialization](/guide/setup/materialization)
- [Integrations](/guide/setup/integrations)

These are all foundational concepts that are used in the examples below.

## Example

Let's start with an example of a basic development environment. A common pattern is to prefix developer versions of databases with `sandbox_`.

For sake of simplicity, we'll use a local provider in this guide, but the same principles apply to remote providers.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup Moms Flower Shop">
    First, let's create a new workspace with the `moms_flower_shop` sample.
    ```shell
    sdf new --sample moms_flower_shop
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add an Environment">
    Next, let's add a new environment to the workspace. This will use the SDF provider for local compute.
    ```yml
    ---
    environment:
        name: dev
        integrations:
          - provider: sdf
            type: database
            targets:
              - pattern: prod_db.*.*
                rename-as: sandbox_prod_db.${1}.${2}
    ```

    {/* TODO (Elias): Add back in generation of output once bug is fixed */}
    {/* ```add yml 
    moms_flower_shop_env/v2.workspace.sdf.yml -> moms_flower_shop/workspace.sdf.yml
    ``` */}

    In this example, we're creating a new environment called `dev`. This environment will use the `local` provider to hydrate tables from the `prod_db` database. 
    We're also specifying that any tables materialized to the `prod_db` database should, if run with this environment, materialize to the `sandbox_prod_db`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compile with the Environment">
    To compile a workspace with the `dev` environment, you can run:
    ```shell
    sdf compile --environment dev
    ```

    or 

    ```shell
    sdf compile -e dev
    ```

    {/* TODO (Elias): Add back in generation of output once bug is fixed */}
    {/* ```run shell 
    cd tmp/moms_flower_shop_env && $sdf compile -e dev
    ``` */}

    Notice the renamed tables in the output! Specifically, the (`aka <renamed-table-name>` after each compiler output).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run with the Environment">
    To run a workspace with the `dev` environment, you can run:
    ```shell
    sdf run --environment dev
    ```

    or 

    ```shell
    sdf run -e dev
    ```

    {/* TODO (Elias): Add back in generation of output once bug is fixed */}
    {/* ```run shell 
    cd tmp/moms_flower_shop_env && $sdf run -e dev
    ``` */}

    The executed tables have been materialized to the renamed fully qualified name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="(Optional) Test on a Remote Provider">
    The same principles apply to remote providers as seen below:

    ```yml
    ---
    environment:
        name: dev
        integrations:
          - provider: snowflake
            type: database
            credentials: local_dev
            sources:
              - pattern: prod_db.*.*
            targets:
              - pattern: prod_db.*.*
                rename-as: sandbox_prod_db.${1}.${2}
    ```

    In this example, we're creating a new environment called `dev`. This environment will use the `snowflake` provider to hydrate tables from the `prod_db` database. 
    We're also specifying that any tables materialized to the `prod_db` database should, if run with this environment, materialize to the `sandbox_prod_db`.

    <Note>
      We're using the `local_dev` credential to authenticate with Snowflake when `sdf compile` or `sdf run` is run with the `dev` environment. This configuration allows for environments to have different credentials for different providers.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>


<Note>
You'll notice in the below example that the schema and table names are being passed through as Jinja variables. 
This is because the `rename-as` field is a Jinja template when used with `*`. In this case, we're renaming the 
schema to `sandbox_prod_db` and keeping the schema and table names the same using `${1}` and `${2}` respectively. 
More about renaming in the next section.
</Note>

### Renaming

In the above example, we used a simple renaming pattern to rename the database. However, you can use more complex renaming patterns to rename the schema and table names. For example, let's say we want to prepend the developer name to all schemas when running in the `dev` environment. We can do this by using the following configuration:

```yml
---
environment:
    name: dev
    integrations:
      - provider: snowflake
        type: database
        credentials: local_dev
        sources:
          - pattern: prod_db.*.*
        targets:
          - pattern: "*.*.*"
            rename-as: ${1}.sandbox_{{ env_var('developer_name') }}_${2}.${3}
```
         
Cool! But there's a lot going on here. Let's break it down:

- `*.*.*` is a wildcard pattern that matches any schema and table name.
- `${1}` is the first match group from the source pattern. In this case, it's the database name. Note that in the previous example, our first `*` represented the schema name since it came after the database name like `<database-name>.*`.
- `sandbox_{{ env_var('developer_name') }}_${2}.${3}` is the new schema and table name. We're prepending `sandbox_` to the schema name, then using the `env_var` function to get the developer's name from the environment variables. Finally, we're appending the table name to the end with `${3}` since that's the third match group from the source pattern.

<Tip>
  When using the `env_var` jinja function for environments and other SDF yml use cases, a common patter is to use a [`.env`](https://www.dotenv.org/) file to store environment variables. This way, you can keep sensitive information out of your codebase.
</Tip>

## Overwriting

Environments allow you to overwrite any configurations from your workspace. For example, let's say you want to use a different database when running in the `dev` environment. You can do this by adding the following configuration:

```yml
---
environment:
    name: dev
    defaults:
      catalog: sandbox_catalog
      schema: sandbox_{{ env_var('developer_name') }}
      materialization: view
    ...
```

In this example, we're overwriting the default `catalog`, `schema`, and `materialization` configurations in the workspace. When running in the `dev` environment, SDF will use the `sandbox_catalog` catalog, the `sandbox_<developer_name>` schema, and materialize tables as `views`.

<Warning>
  The environment block is like a workspace block. If any defaults or includes blocks are overwritten, none of the defaults set on the workspace level will be preserved. There is no merging! If it is not redefined, it takes the value from the workspace block.
</Warning>

## Default Environment

You can also set a default environment in your workspace. This is useful when you want to run SDF with a specific environment without having to specify it each time. To set a default environment, you can add the following configuration:

```yml
workspace:
  ...
  defaults:
    environment: dev
  ...
```
