  "Expand SDF Built-in Libraries with custom logic"
---

SDF comes with built-in open-source libraries (learn more about our [open source libs](/introduction/open-source)).
To further increase SDF's compatibility, it is possible to expand those built-in libs with custom logic.

The following guide will explain how to do so, step by step.

##Setup
<Steps> 
    <Step title="Open an SDF workspace">
        For the sake of the example, we will use our `tests` sample workspace.
        However, you can always use your existing SDF workspace to follow along.
        
        To create the `tests` workspace, run the following command:
        ```shell
        sdf new --sample tests & cd tests
        ```

        ```
        run shell
        cd tmp && $sdf new --sample tests
        ```
        
        There are slight syntax differences for expanding each library.
        To keep it simple, we will focus our example on tests and point
        out the implementation differences for other libs.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a New Libs Folder">
        Within your workspace, create a new folder. We will call it `my_lib`, 
        but any name would work. This is where we will add our custom logic in 
        later steps.

        If you are using the `tests` example, your workspace should look like this:

        ```
        run quiet
        cd tmp/tests && mkdir my_lib
        ```

        ```
        run shell
        cd tmp/tests && tree .
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Copy SDF's Built-in Lib">
        One option is to copy the libraries from GitHub:
        - [SDF Tests](https://github.com/sdf-labs/tests), 
        - [SDF Materialization](https://github.com/sdf-labs/materialization), 
        - [SDF Utils](https://github.com/sdf-labs/utils)

        Another option is to copy them from `sdfTarget`.
        If you don't have an `sdfTarget` directory, all you need to do is 
        to compile your workspace:

        ```shell 
        sdf compile
        ```
        If your compilation was successful, you will see `sdfTarget` in your
        workspace:
        
        ```
        run shell
        cd tmp/tests && sdf compile --show none && tree . -L 4 -a
        ```

        SDF's libraries will be located under `sdfTarget/dbg/.lib`.

        
        Let's copy `sdf_test` to our new custom libraries folder:

        ```
        run quiet
        cd tmp/tests && cp -R sdfTarget/dbg/.lib/sdf_test my_lib
        ```
        
        ```
        run error
        cd tmp/tests && tree ./my_lib 
        ```

        <Tip>
            You can choose to keep the library name as is, `sdf_test`, 
            or change it if there's another name you'd prefer to use.
        </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add Custom Library to the Workspace YML">
        Now, we need to add our new library to the workspace configuration.
        In our `workspace.sdf.yml` file, let's add the following section:

        ```yml
        workspace:
            ...
            dependencies:
                - name: sdf_test
                  path: my_lib/sdf_tests  <-- or a different folder name
            ...
        ```

        Notice, we are using SDF's built-in library name, `sdf_test`. 
        However, we can also choose a different name to our library. If 
        we decide to do so, we'll need to indicate it in the defaults.

        Let's assume we call the new tests library `new_tests`:
        ```yml
        workspace:
            ...
            dependencies:
                - name: new_tests  <-- this is the new lib name
                  path: my_lib/sdf_tests  <-- or a different folder name
            defaults:
                test-lib: new_tests  <-- this is the new lib name
            ...
        ```

        If we want to add another type of custom lib with a non-default
        name, we should add to the defaults section:
        <CodeGroup>
        ```yml workspace.sdf.yml (materialization)
        ...
        defaults:
            materialization-lib: new_mat  <-- This is a non-default name
        ...
        ```
        ```yml workspace.sdf.yml (utils)
        ...
        defaults:
            utils-lib: new_utils  <-- This is a non-default name
        ...
        ```
        </CodeGroup>

        <Tip>
        - We can have more than one custom lib added to a workspace. 
            Each lib is independent of the rest.
        - We can create an environment to include the custom libs rather 
        than include it in the main workspace configuration. It'll look like this:
        ```yml
        workspace:
            ...
        ---
        environment:
            name: custom_libs
            dependencies:
                - name: sdf_test
                  path: my_lib/sdf_test
            ...
        ```
        </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Expand Your Lib">
        Let's add some custom logic!

        Open the lib file. It will be located under `my_lib/sdf_test/macro/test.jinja`.
        If you changed any folder names, make sure to apply the changes to locate
        the relevant file.

        Copy the following macro to the top of your custom tests lib:
        ```jinja my_lib/sdf_test/macro/test.jinja
        {% macro custom_column_test(severity, column_name) -%}
            COUNT(CASE WHEN {{ column_name }} > 1000 THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) > 0 
            ==> 
            '{{severity}}: column {{ column_name }} is over 1000"' 
        {%- endmacro %}
        ```

        <Note>
            We are keeping it simple and merely checking that the column value is below 1000,
            but of course, you can implement any custom and complex logic here.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Try It!">
        First, we need to add the test to our table yml file, just like for SDF's built-in tests 
        (to learn more, visit our [Tests Guide](/guide/data-quality/tests)).
        In the file `src_metadata/raw_inapp_events.sdf.yml`, add our new custom test
        to the column `event_name`:
        ```yml src_metadata/raw_inapp_events.sdf.yml
        table:
            ...
            columns:
                - name: index
                    description: row_number
                    tests:
                        - expect: custom_column_test()  <-- this is our new test!
                          severity: warning
            ... 
        ```

        Let's run the test! In your terminal, execute:
        ```shell
        sdf test
        ```

        The test passed! 
        ```
        add yml
        custom_libs/raw_inapp_events.sdf.yml -> tests/src_metadata/raw_inapp_events.sdf.yml
        ```
        ```
        add yml
        custom_libs/workspace.sdf.yml -> tests/workspace.sdf.yml
        ```

        ```
        add jinja
        custom_libs/test.jinja -> tests/my_lib/sdf_test/macros/test.jinja
        ```
        
        ```
        run shell
        cd tmp/tests && sdf test
        ```

        We can look at the compiled tests query located in the file 
        `sdftarget/dbg/preprocessed/sdftarget/dbg/tests/tests_workspace/pub/test_raw_inapp_events.sql`.
        Notice our custom logic in the compiled query:

        ```
        run shell
        cd tmp/tests && cat sdftarget/dbg/preprocessed/sdftarget/dbg/tests/tests_workspace/pub/test_raw_inapp_events.sql
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
