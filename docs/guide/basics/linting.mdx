### SDF's SQL Linter

Welcome to the future of SQL linting! 

We have redefined SQL linting, setting a new standard for how we can help Data Engineers achieve readability, 
reliability, and performance in the data transformation layer. Our SQL Linter is build on top of SDF's core engine 
to ensure **unmatched accuracy, performance, and depth of rules** compared with standard SQL linters.

#### 100x Faster
> SDF's linter is 100x Faster than standard SQL Linters since it's built with Rust 
and utilizes SDF's sophisticated caching mechanism.

#### Accurate
> Accurately detect issues in your SQL by relying on SDF's core engine

#### Advanced rules
> We provide advanced typing, optimization, and custom governance rules by 
leveraging to SDF's one-of-a-kind SQL semantic understanding
> - **Semantic rules** - derived from our semantic understanding of your SQL (e.g., 
[prevent type cohesion](/reference/lint-rules#disallow-implicit-conversions-in))
> - **Performance rules** - dialect-specific optimizations (e.g., [prevent function application
on indexed columns when filtering](/reference/lint-rules#flag-function-application-in-where-on-indexed-columns))
> - **SDF Checks** - create [custom lint rules](/reference/lint-rules#check-rules) on top of SDF's information schema 

<Note>
Advanced rules rely on SDF's compilation and will automatically execute `sdf compile` as a 
pre-requisite.

### Linting Rule Types

| Parameter | Description | Standard SQL Linter | SDF
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Layout rules** | [SQL formatting rules](/guide/basics/linting#layout-rules) | 🟢 | 🟢 |
| **Syntax rules** | [SQL syntax consistency and best practices rules](/guide/basics/linting#syntax-rules) | 🟡 | 🟢 |
| **Semantic rules** | [Logic and datatype related guardrails](/guide/basics/linting#semantic-rules) | 🔴 | 🟢 |
| **Performance rules** | [Performance enhancement recommendations](/guide/basics/linting#performance-rules) | 🔴 | 🟢 |
| **[Custom SDF Checks rules](/guide/data-quality/checks)** | [Checks against SDF's information schema](/guide/basics/linting#sdf-checks-rules) | 🔴 | 🟢 |


### Find Issues

- Use `sdf lint` to evaluate your SQL code against a set of linting rules
- You can lint a subset of models by specifying targets for the command: `sdf lint [TARGET]`
- [Default linter configuration](/guide/basics/linting#default-configuration)

{/* TODO: Add demo video */}

{/*
### Fix Problems

- Use `sdf lint fmt` to automatically resolve all formatting issues
- For issues that can't be automatically fixed, we will provide explanations detailing 
why and where the rule has failed. You can always `cmd+click` the linter's output to open
the exact location in the model
- To ignore a specific error, add the inline-comment `-- noqa` to your query. 
This will prevent that line from being evaluated

### Customize and Configure 
- By default, `sdf lint` uses SDF's recommended rules and configuration
- To customize our linter rules according to your preferences, override the default 
settings with a `linter-rules` configuration block in your `workspace.sdf.yml`

```yml workspace.sdf.yml
workspace:
  ...
  defaults:
    linter-rules: my_custom_linter
  ...

---
linter-rules:
    name: my_custom_linter
    syntax-rules:
        flag-inconsistent-grouping: on
        ...
    semantic-rules: # semantic-rules
        disallow-implicit-conversions-in: [eq,in]
        ...
    ...
```

<Note>
The linter config block will override the default configuration.
</Note>

#### Default Rules
``` yml
---
linter: 
  name: default_linter
  syntax-rules:
    case-keyword: consistent 
    case-literal: consistent 
    case-type: consistent   
    disallow-these-identifiers: []  
    flag-keywords-used-as-identifiers: on  
    disallow-these-chars-in-quoted-identifiers: ".#%{}\\<>*?/$!'\":@+`|="  
    flag-unnecessary-quoted-identifiers: on  
    inconsistent-column-reference: consistent  
    flag-dereference-in-join-relation: on  
    flag-inconsistent-grouping: on  
    flag-unnecessary-else: on 
    flag-unnecessary-case: on 
    flag-unnecessary-cte: on  
    flag-unnecessary-nested-case: on 
    flag-distinct-parenthesis: on 
    disallow-subquery-in: [from, join] 
    flag-misordered-join-condition: on 
    flag-select-item-order: on 
    flag-trailing-semicolon-after-statements: on  

  semantic-rules:
    disallow-implicit-conversions-in: [] # (off) 
```

### CI Integration
To learn how to integrate SDF into your CI/CD workflow, check out our 
[CI/CD guide](/integrations/cicd/ci_cd). Once the integration is set up, 
just add the `sdf lint` command to the workflow configuration:
```
on:
  pull_request:
...
    - uses: sdf-labs/sdf-action@v0
      with:
        sdf_version: 'latest'
        command: 'sdf lint' 
        snowflake_account_id: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
        snowflake_username: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME }}
        snowflake_password: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD }}
        snowflake_role: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_ROLE }}
        snowflake_warehouse: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE }}
```

<Tip>
You can specify a target for the command to only run `sdf lint` on a partial DAG
